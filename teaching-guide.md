## Assessment Criteria

Participants should be evaluated based on:
1. Completion of practical exercises
2. Understanding of core concepts
3. Ability to troubleshoot issues
4. Final project implementation
5. Code quality and adherence to best practices

## Final Project

## Instructor Preparation Checklist

Before teaching the course:
1. Ensure Snowflake access for all participants
2. Prepare a pre-configured environment for quick setup
3. Create reference implementation for exercises
4. Prepare troubleshooting guides for common issues
5. Set up a shared documentation space for questions
